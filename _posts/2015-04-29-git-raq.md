## Fork的项目如何与源项目同步更新

To get started on Linux:

Unpack the .zip file you've downloaded. The SDK files are download separately to a user-specified directory.

Make a note of the name and location of the SDK directory on your system—you will need to refer to the SDK directory later when using the SDK tools from the command line.

Troubleshooting Ubuntu

If you need help installing and configuring Java on your development machine, you might find these resources helpful:

Here are the steps to install Java:
If you are running a 64-bit distribution on your development machine, you need to install additional packages first. For Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) and above, install the libncurses5:i386, libstdc++6:i386, and zlib1g:i386 packages using apt-get:
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 zlib1g:i386
For earlier versions of Ubuntu, install the ia32-libs package using apt-get:
apt-get install ia32-libs
Next, install Java:
apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
The Android SDK tools are now ready to begin developing apps, but there are still a couple packages you should add to make your Android SDK complete.
